## About Me

I am a PhD student in <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical & Computer Engineering </a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank"> Georgia Tech</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.mdav.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Mark Davenport</a>. My areas of research include active learning and learning from similarity comparisons.

## Current Research

My research focuses on developing methods for learning data efficient models based on learning from similarity comparisons and active learning. The motivation behind using comparisons comes from the idea that it is easier to compare differentdata samples than evaluate every sample on an absolute basis. Active learning aims to reduce the label complexity of tasks by selecting the most informative samples to be labeled. 

I’m interested in leveraging similarity comparisons to motivate task agnostic active learning schemes and also designing active methods to select labels while considering the bias influencing human responses. I’m interested in understanding how the problem considered and the modality of the data affect the design of active data selection methods. To study the performance of these methods, I have worked on problems such as metric learning - which involves learning a representation of objects via comparisons of distances between them, classification - where label acquisition is formulated as a problem of soliciting responses to similarity queries and preference learning - where the objective is to estimate a user based on their item preferences.
