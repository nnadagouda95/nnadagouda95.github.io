## About Me

I am a PhD student in <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical & Computer Engineering </a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank"> Georgia Tech</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.mdav.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Mark Davenport</a>. My areas of research include active learning and learning from similarity comparisons.

## Current Research

My research focuses on developing methods for learning data efficient models based on learning from similarity comparisons and active learning. The motivation behind using comparisons stems from the idea that it is easier to compare different objects than evaluate every object on an absolute basis. Active learning aims to reduce the label complexity of tasks by selecting the optimal objects to be labelled. 

To study the performance of these methods, I have been considering problems such as metric learning - which involves learning a representation of objects via comparisons of distances between them, classification - where label acquisition is formulated as a problem of soliciting response to similarity queries and preference learning - where the objective is to estimate a user based on their item preferences. Further, I'm interested in contrastive learning which involves learning representations from unlabelled data with the intent of performing well on some downstream tasks. The aim here is to study the conditions under which good performance in the former step ensures good results in the downstream tasks.
